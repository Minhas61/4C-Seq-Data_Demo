Demultiplex and trim raw reads to 30bps, either read1 or read2, use demultiplex.py and trim.py to run this
Download in fasta format and buid genome index using bowtie at the cluster
Run the 4C.pl pipeline at the cluster, either through SLURM or MIP job submissions, check 4C.pl for further requirements
Load smooth_data and wigfiles on genome browsers to check profile peak distributions at the view point, if happy proceed with further analysis
Check bowtie.log for further info on mapping
Use interact.R to run interaction calling on fragscounts files following 4C.pl and then check plots if they are fine, head the Coutput see how it looks
Proceed to identify True interactors, using True_interactions.R
Merge using bedtool merge.... bedtool merge.txt
Look at the merge regions/ which are now interactors in the browser also, but put heads/descriptions, then concatinate for easier uploading and labelling in browsers
